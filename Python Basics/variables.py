num1 = 12; #integer number
num2 = 23.47 #floating point number


print(num1) #prints the integer
print(num2) #prints the floating point number

#Now the thing is that floating point number when added with an integer, the result will be flaoting point number. Example

print(f"the addition of {num1} and {num2} is %d" % (num1+num2))
